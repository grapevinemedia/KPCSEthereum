The specific features of the blockchain (cryptographically-enforced security, immutability, transparency, public availability of data) could be a dramatic improvement over the current system of paper certificates and their known weaknesses, such as forgery, varying certificate security features and design, and overly-generous expiration dates (and therefore the possibility of re-use).\r\n\r\n[A more general overview of my proposal is available here on Medium.com](https://medium.com/@jacksonadams/my-complete-thoughts-on-diamonds-are-here-5e1a27e2acbe#.th0kk2edm)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##Definitions\r\n\r\n###Participant\r\nMember countries that are participants in The Kimberley Process.\r\n[Here is a current list of participant countries](http://www.kimberleyprocess.com/en/participants)\r\n\r\n###Participant Authority\r\nAn authority designated by the Particpant with the power to issue certificates. For example, the _Ministry of Mines and Mineral Resources (Sierra Leone)_. These authorities do not issue certificates directly, but rather delegate those powers to specific employees, or agents.\r\n\r\n###Participant Agent\r\nAn individual designated by a Participant Authority with the power to issue certificates.\r\n\r\n###Party\r\nAn entity or individual acting as either the source or destination of the shipment of rough diamonds over international borders, ie a rough diamond trader, manufacturer or mining company.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##Certificate issuance process:\r\n\r\n###1. A certificate is created by the exporting party, with references to:\r\n- the importing party we are sending the shipment to\r\n- the source participant\r\n- the destination participant\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n//Certificate.sol:\r\n    function Certificate(address _kpcs,\r\n        address _exporter,\r\n        address _importer,\r\n        address _participantSource,\r\n        address _participantDestination)\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach certificate must contain the following data:\r\n\r\n1. Participants\r\n\t- _Origins:_ geological origins where goods were mined from. _Note: This value is not set directly, but is derived from the origins of the parsels._\r\n\t- _Source:_ participant country the shipment is being sent from.\r\n\t- _Destination:_ participant country the shipment is being sent to.\r\n\r\n2. Agents\r\n\t- _Exporting:_ agent delegated by source participant's exporting authority the power to sign certificates.\r\n\t- _Importing:_ agent delegated by destination participant's importing authority the power to sign certificates.\r\n\r\n3. Parties\r\n\t- _Exporting:_ entity or individual goods are being sent from\r\n\t- _Importing:_ entity or individual goods are being sent to\r\n\r\n4. Parsels\r\n\t- An array consisting of parsels of goods included in the shipment. Data includes:\r\n\t\t- carats\r\n\t\t- value\r\n\t\t- geological origins\r\n\r\n###2. Parsels are added to the certificate:\r\n```solidity\r\n//Certificate.sol\r\nfunction addParsel(uint carats,\r\n\tuint value,\r\n\taddress[] origins) {\r\n\t\t...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nEach parsel contains:\r\n- Carats\r\n- Assessed value\r\n- Addresses of participant countries of geological origins\r\n\r\nFinally, the creator must call: `Certificate.completedAddingParsels` to complete the parsel addition process, and request the authorities and parties to sign the certificate\r\n\r\n###3. Await signatures from:\r\n1. Importing party\r\n2. Exporting authority's agent\r\n3. Importing authority's agent\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n//Certificate.sol\r\nfunction sign() {\r\n\t...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of the last required signature (order is unimportant), the certificate is issued and shipment is cleared for the final step: validation.\r\n\r\n###4. Certificate must be added to the main instance of KPCS.\r\nThis ensures that all participants noted on the certificate are recognized by the main instance of KPCS, therefore validating the certificate and adding a reference to it to from the main KPCS instance.\r\n\r\n###5. Importing authority marks shipment as received:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n//Certificate.sol:\r\nfunction markAsReceived() {\r\n\t...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpon acknowleged receipt of the shipment, the importing authority marks the certificate as received, completing the certificate.\r\nNote: according to the KPCS Core Document, this step is optional.\r\n",
