The Kimberley Process (KP) is a joint government, industry and civil society initiative to stem the flow of conflict diamonds â€“ rough diamonds used by rebel movements to finance wars against legitimate governments.

Beyond the often-raised criticisms of the policy, scope and rules of the KPCS, flaws in the technical execution of the scheme are quite evident in the integrity of the certificates themselves, and therefore also in the entire process.

In order to bring both transparency and integrity to the KP, my proposal is to put the entirety of the certificate issuance process, as well as all participants, authorities, observers, agents and parties, on the Ethereum Blockchain. The specific features of the blockchain (mathematically-enforced security, immutability, independence from any trusted 3rd party) would be a dramatic improvement over the current system of paper certificates and the ramifications and their known liabilities, such as  forgery, varying certificate security features, generous expiration dates (and therefore the possibility of re-use), etc.
